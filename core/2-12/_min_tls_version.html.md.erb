In the **Select the range of TLS versions supported by the Gorouter and HAProxy** field, select the version range of TLS to use in Gorouter and HAProxy communications. The Gorouter and HAProxy use TLS v1.2 - v1.3 by default. If you need to accommodate clients that use an older version of TLS, select a lower minimum version. For a list of TLS ciphers supported by the Gorouter, see [TLS Cipher Suite Support](../adminguide/securing-traffic.html#ciphers) in _Securing Traffic into <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>_.
